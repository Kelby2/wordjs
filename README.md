Addictive word-finding puzzle game. The goal is to find as many words as you can given the allotted time. Challenge your friends to see who can find more words!

## Gameplay
Press the New Word button at the bottom of the page to generate new letters. Within the allotted time (2 minutes), type into the field as many words as you can find with the six letters.

The side panels show all valid words (3-6 letters in length) that can be made using the letters, based on a modified [dictionary](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) of all english words from user dwyl.

The words remain concealed until the player finds them. If the player concedes, or when time runs out, all remaining words will be displayed.
